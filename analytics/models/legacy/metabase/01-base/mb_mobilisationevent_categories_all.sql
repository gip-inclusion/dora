-- NOTE(vperron) : this model and the other one about mobilisation events
-- makes me think that there is a weird and probably unnecessary schema issue here,
-- tables are similar to the point they can be JOINED but one has an 'id' and the other a 'di_id',
-- meaning they could probably be in the same table...
